## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create a responsive team page using Flexbox.
- Align and distribute team member blocks.
- Display NFT card and author.
- Make the design responsive for both desktop and mobile views.
- Ensure proper use of CSS properties like margin, padding, and box-sizing.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design (mobile-first workflow)
- CSS variables

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use Hover and after. Additionally, I learned how to use variables in CSS to reuse them in the design. Here is an example of variables in CSS.

```css
:root {
    --primary-soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
    --primary-cian:hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    --neutral-very-dark-blue-main-bg: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    --neutral-very-dark-blue-card-bg: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    --neutral-very-dark-blue-line: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
    --neutral-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue refining my knowledge of Flexbox and CSS variables to better handle layouts. I also plan to explore more responsive design techniques to ensure that my designs are accessible on a wide range of devices.

### Useful resources

- [Conceptos b√°sicos de flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - This helped me to vertically sort the blocks.
- [:hover CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - It helped me to add interaction.
- [::after CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) - It helped me to add interaction.
